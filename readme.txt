WELCOME TO BLOONS TOWER DEFENSE

This is game based off of Ninja Kiwi's original game, Bloons Tower Defense 3. 

The objective of this game is to survive with the most money. The way to accomplish this is
to place towers throughout the map which fire bullets. When the start button is clicked,
balloons will start to follow the green path. Place the towers by right clicking on the 
intended location. Place these towers strategically so the number of lives does not go below 0.
If you have enough money, you can upgrade the towers. You can also change the direction of
shooting of the towers by scrolling UP or DOWN on the direction button above the towers. You
can create your own map by clicking the create button on the home screen, if you choose. For
your assistance, there is a rectangle on the bottom left corner of the screen detailing
the description of the tower when selected. After getting passed five levels per game mode,
you win the game!
